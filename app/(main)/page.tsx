      <p>Hello, I&apos;m Harry.</p>
      <p>I care about the future of humans and machines. Powerful artificial intelligence is possible, and when I'm not working to align it, I enjoy writing, talking, wearing sweaters, believing, and seeing. On earth as it is in heaven.</p>
      <p>I&apos;m currently studying math at the University of California, Irvine.</p>
