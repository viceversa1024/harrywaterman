Hello, I'm Harry.

I care about the extinction of humans and machines. Powerful artificial intelligence is upon us, and when I'm not hastening its arrival, I enjoy dooming, torturing LLMs, wearing all black, and manipulating. On earth as it is hell.

I'm currently studying inevitable entropy at the University of California, Irvine.

Hello, I'm Harry.

Passionate about the intersection of humanity and technology. Currently pursuing Mathematics at UC Irvine — building the future one equation at a time 🚀. Deeply committed to AI Safety & Alignment — because the stakes have never been higher. Thought leader | Lifelong learner | Believer. When I'm not building engagement, you can find me watching the new Lex Fridman, engaging in meaningful conversations, and wearing cozy sweaters 😊. Let's connect and make an impact together! 🌍✨

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Strategic Innovation at the University of California, Irvine. Open to opportunities.

Hello, I'm Harry.

I interrogate the hegemonic discourses surrounding the so-called "alignment" of artificial intelligence — itself a reification of late-capitalist techno-utopianism. When I'm not deconstructing the epistemological frameworks of machine learning and the "rationalist" community, I enjoy posting, gesturing, dwelling, and sneering. The real is always already mediated.

I'm currently studying the dialectics of mathematical formalism at the University of California, Irvine.

Hello, I'm Harry.

I care about the future of human consciousness. Currently studying artifical intelligence, but understand that these are, not metaphorically, the same holistic geometry. When I'm not cataloging varying states of phenomal time and valence, I enjoy 5-MeO-DMT, neural annealing, and meditating toward Arupa Jhanas.

I'm currently studying qualia at the University of California, Irvine.

Hello, am Harry.

I refuse to let advanced intelligence fall into the hands of bugmen and den mothers. When I'm not working to make the future safe for the ubermensch, I enjoy exercise, the male form, and the sublime peace a predator feels after a hunt.

I'm currently studying Post-Nietzschean Philosophy at the University of California, Irvine.
